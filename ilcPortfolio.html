        <p>
            I come from a very large family. I grew up with people constantly around me, whether I wanted it or not.
            This taught me many valuable things early in life, but the most important is valuing your own personality
            and Individuality. No matter how similar your experiences might be to someone else, no one will have the
            same exact memories, values, or perception of things. I am the only one with my Individuality and I want to
            use it to make an impact on the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am determined to succeed, committed to doing what it takes, and passionate about creating a better life
            for myself and those around me.

            I worked many years as a pharmacy technician while going to school part time and graduated in 2018 from KSU
            with a B.S. in Biology. I gained interest in technology and software engineering a few years ago from a
            roommate. I started working through an online bootcamp and really enjoyed it and learning there are so many
            possibilities you can apply this to. I also enjoy playing sports, outdoor activities and <a
